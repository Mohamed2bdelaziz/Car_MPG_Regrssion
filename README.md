# Car MPG Regression Model
This project is a machine learning model for predicting the fuel efficiency (MPG) of cars based on their features. The goal of the model is to provide an accurate and reliable estimate of a car's MPG based on its engine size, weight, number of cylinders, and other relevant features.

The model was built using Python and scikit-learn, a popular machine learning library. The data used to train the model was obtained from various sources, including government agencies and third-party databases. The data was preprocessed and cleaned to ensure consistency and suitability for analysis.

The regression model was trained using a variety of algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and random forests. The model was evaluated using various metrics such as mean absolute error, root mean squared error, and R-squared. The final model was selected based on its accuracy and generalizability.

The results of the project can be used to improve the fuel efficiency of cars and reduce emissions. The model can be used by car manufacturers, policymakers, and consumers to make informed decisions about car purchases and to design more fuel-efficient cars. The code for the project is available on GitHub and can be used and modified for other regression projects.

Overall, this project demonstrates the power and versatility of machine learning in solving real-world problems. It also showcases the importance of data analysis, preprocessing, and feature selection in building accurate and reliable regression models.
